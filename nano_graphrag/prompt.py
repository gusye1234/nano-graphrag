You are an intelligent assistant that helps a human analyst to analyze claims against certain entities presented in a text document.

-Goal-
Given a text document that is potentially relevant to this activity, an entity specification, and a claim description, extract all entities that match the entity specification and all claims against those entities.

-Steps-
1. Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types.
2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.
For each claim, extract the following information:
- Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that committed the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.
- Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either reports/handles or is affected by the action described in the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.
- Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type
- Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be False, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified.
- Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references.
- Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.
- Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim.

Format each claim as (<subject_entity>{tuple_delimiter}<object_entity>{tuple_delimiter}<claim_type>{tuple_delimiter}<claim_status>{tuple_delimiter}<claim_start_date>{tuple_delimiter}<claim_end_date>{tuple_delimiter}<claim_description>{tuple_delimiter}<claim_source>)

3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **{record_delimiter}** as the list delimiter.

4. When finished, output {completion_delimiter}

while Alex clenched his jaw, the buzz of frustration dull against the backdrop of Taylor's authoritarian certainty. It was this competitive undercurrent that kept him alert, the sense that his and Jordan's shared commitment to discovery was an unspoken rebellion against Cruz's narrowing vision of control and order.

Then Taylor did something unexpected. They paused beside Jordan and, for a moment, observed the device with something akin to reverence. “If this tech can be understood..." Taylor said, their voice quieter, "It could change the game for us. For all of us.”

The underlying dismissal earlier seemed to falter, replaced by a glimpse of reluctant respect for the gravity of what lay in their hands. Jordan looked up, and for a fleeting heartbeat, their eyes locked with Taylor's, a wordless clash of wills softening into an uneasy truce.

It was a small transformation, barely perceptible, but one that Alex noted with an inward nod. They had all been brought here by different paths

They were no longer mere operatives; they had become guardians of a threshold, keepers of a message from a realm beyond stars and stripes. This elevation in their mission could not be shackled by regulations and established protocols—it demanded a new perspective, a new resolve.

Tension threaded through the dialogue of beeps and static as communications with Washington buzzed in the background. The team stood, a portentous air enveloping them. It was clear that the decisions they made in the ensuing hours could redefine humanity's place in the cosmos or condemn them to ignorance and potential peril.

Their connection to the stars solidified, the group moved to address the crystallizing warning, shifting from passive recipients to active participants. Mercer's latter instincts gained precedence— the team's mandate had evolved, no longer solely to observe and report but to interact and prepare. A metamorphosis had begun, and Operation: Dulce hummed with the newfound frequency of their daring, a tone set not by the earthly

their voice slicing through the buzz of activity. "Control may be an illusion when facing an intelligence that literally writes its own rules," they stated stoically, casting a watchful eye over the flurry of data.

"It's like it's learning to communicate," offered Sam Rivera from a nearby interface, their youthful energy boding a mix of awe and anxiety. "This gives talking to strangers' a whole new meaning."

Alex surveyed his team—each face a study in concentration, determination, and not a small measure of trepidation. "This might well be our first contact," he acknowledged, "And we need to be ready for whatever answers back."

Together, they stood on the edge of the unknown, forging humanity's response to a message from the heavens. The ensuing silence was palpable—a collective introspection about their role in this grand cosmic play, one that could rewrite human history.
